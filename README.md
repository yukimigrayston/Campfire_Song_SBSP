# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...

C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song!
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song!
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-O-N-G song!
Patrick! 
Song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E
Squidward!
Good!

It'll help 
It'll help 
If you just sing along
Oh Yeah!
